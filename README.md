## *Repository Archived*

Due to Twitter deterioration, we can no longer view other user's "Likes" are no longer viewable.  
Therefore, this application will no longer work and will be archived.

I strongly hope that a way will be provided to make "Likes" public at the will of the account owner.

# watch-twitter-likes

👀 Watch Twitter users likes and notify to discord.
